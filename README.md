# Unnecesary.js

An utterly useless excercise in re-writing native JavaScript functions.

The general idea is to reverse-engineer JavaScript's inner workings, 
both to get a better understanding of how JavaScript works, 
and also to write easily-understandable code that any budding JavaScript 
code-monkey can look at and know what's going on.

While writing efficient code is ideal, this project is focussed on readability, 
and accurately recreating the functionality and quirks of how JavaScript works.

Here is the list of all re-created functionality:
- Array.sort
- event-loop
